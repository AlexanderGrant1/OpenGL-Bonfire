# OpenGL-Bonfire
A bonfire in the middle of a forest that I wrote for a university graphics assignment.

A video of this project is here:

The video doesn't look nearly as good as the original scene so I would recommend downloading this project and running it if you are interested in seeing what it looks like.  This can be done by downloading the executable and dependencies here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxRpXW4tz6uNcjgxYnNGbnIzd00/view?usp=sharing
