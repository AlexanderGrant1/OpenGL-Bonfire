# OpenGL-Bonfire
A bonfire in the middle of a forest that I wrote for a university graphics assignment.

I produced a video for this but the video recording software didn't capture it very well.  I have provided a download link so that you can see the code in action here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxRpXW4tz6uNcjgxYnNGbnIzd00/view?usp=sharing
